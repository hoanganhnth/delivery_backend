# Order tranche inventory (2026-10-05)

Scope: domain equivalence slices on `refactor/order-core`. References below are
pre-extraction host line numbers. Authority: `docs/platform/product/features/order-lifecycle.md`,
`docs/workflows/order_lifecycle_flow.md`, consolidation plan, and executable host behavior.
No plan, topic, schema, flag or business-policy changes are authorized.

| Workflow / entrypoint (under order-service/src/main/java/com/delivery/order_service/) | Decisions and guarantees before extraction |
| --- | --- |
| Preview: controller/OrderController.java:54; service/CheckoutPreviewService.java:107 | USER admission; canonical Restaurant/menu facts, livestream/flash/voucher gating and incompatibilities, duplicates, prices, shipping and ETA. Read/remote calls; CheckoutQuoteIssuer persists a principal/input/pricing-bound quote with expiry. |
| Create: controller/OrderController.java:67; service/impl/OrderServiceImpl.java:149,165,216,277 | Customer admission before bounded concurrency permit; scoped idempotency lease before preflight, exact completed replay read with ownership; quote owner/input/expiry/reprice, canonical Restaurant/menu validation in OrderValidationService.java:76; no client monetary authority. Preflight precedes TransactionTemplate write. Receipt re-claim, zero-price shell flush, inventory/flash reserves, subtotal/shipping/vouchers, item/money snapshots, inventory commit, quote lock/consume, receipt completion and order.created outbox. Remote reservation failure releases identical IDs; TTL is recovery fence. Optional rails/default flags remain host configuration. |
| Quote: service/CheckoutQuoteService.java:47,83 | Read/reprice without write lock across HTTP; changed price issues replacement quote and PRICE_CHANGED; final consume pessimistically locks owner/expiry/unused quote inside create transaction. |
| Create retry: service/OrderCreateIdempotencyService.java:43,74,99,124,140 | Unique principal+key, SHA-256 effective command, H2/Postgres atomic insert, processing token/lease expiry and in-progress conflict; final claim requires current live owner. Completed receipt binds order; failure releases only owned incomplete lease. |
| Saga status: listener/SagaCommandListener.java:57; service/SagaOrderCommandProcessor.java:36,52,68,105 | JSON/UUID/order identity admission, exact sagaStatus routing (SHIPPER_FOUND maps WAIT_SHIPPER_CONFIRM); raw-payload SHA-256 inbox claim BEFORE pessimistic order lock. Exact event replay returns false without order mutation; contradictory identity/payload IllegalArgumentException. Nonpositive sequence accepted only at cursor 0; <=cursor sequenced command commits receipt without mutation; next sequence updates cursor before status handler; gap throws retryable host exception and rolls back receipt/cursor/state. ACK after transactional processor returns; poison IllegalArgumentException excluded from retry, other errors wrapped. |
| Delivery progression: service/impl/OrderEventServiceImpl.java:51; entity/OrderStatus.java:36 | Locked order, simulation-context equality before status mapping; strict canonical state table, same status no save/notes/timestamp; PENDING→CONFIRMED→FINDING_SHIPPER bridges cross-topic confirmation race; finding clears shipper. Host saves/timestamps/notes, no new event here. |
| Assignment / no shipper: service/impl/OrderEventServiceImpl.java:228; service/impl/OrderServiceImpl.java:854 | Assignment validates context and positive shipper; ASSIGNED/PICKED_UP/DELIVERING/DELIVERED exact shipper replay no-op, other shipper conflicts. No-shipper mutates only CONFIRMED/FINDING_SHIPPER/WAIT_SHIPPER_CONFIRM, otherwise no-op; overwrite retry note, retain distinct terminal state, enqueue refund-eligible in same transaction. Host wraps all no-shipper failures in IllegalStateException. |
| Restaurant decision: listener/RestaurantEventListener.java:44,71; service/impl/OrderEventServiceImpl.java:149,185 | Lock order before decision receipt; validate event/actor/restaurant, serialized-event fingerprint, unique event/order, exact replay no-op and contradictory replay fail-closed. Late confirmation records receipt without regressing advanced state; reject requires PENDING, publishes cancellation snapshot/outbox. ACK follows transaction return. |
| Payment compatibility: listener/PaymentEventListener.java:34,60; service/impl/OrderEventServiceImpl.java:102,121 | Locked order; COD completion does nothing/failure ignored; non-COD pending completion confirms, failure transitions CANCELLED and enqueues typed system cancellation. Not active online checkout; preserve compatibility rail. |
| Cancellation/refund boundary: controller/OrderController.java:174; service/impl/OrderServiceImpl.java:748,790,821,834; service/OrderEventPublisher.java:75,98 | Pessimistic order lock, principal ownership or default-off enforcement legacy fallback; ADMIN bypasses eligibility guard but still must pass transition table. Customer/owner pre-pickup only. Exact cancelled actor+reason replay no save/event; conflicting replay fails. Persist cancellation and typed source/reason immutable money/reservation snapshot in mandatory transactional outbox. No provider refund here; Settlement owns downstream gated eligibility/provider decisions. |
| Outbox: service/OrderOutboxService.java:32,39; service/OrderOutboxRelay.java:112,145; service/OrderOutboxLeaseService.java:26,46,61 | MANDATORY enqueue with stable event ID/trace/correlation; short row-lock lease claim, Kafka outside DB transaction, token-fenced SENT/failure update, expiry reclaim, bounded retries/DEAD. Publish-before-mark can duplicate: at-least-once, consumers must use receipts. Payload rehydration preserves contract type headers. |
| Reads: controller/OrderController.java:103,113,124,151,163; service/impl/OrderServiceImpl.java:594,615,631,669,680,710 | Read-only paged queries; ADMIN unrestricted detail/global status/all; USER own principal; restaurant owner creator principal; unmigrated legacy fallback only while enforcement off; SHIPPER detail compares legacy userId to stored shipperId. No external identity hot-path lookup. Restaurant list service helper itself has no authorization (not public controller route). |
| Internal eligibility: controller/InternalOrderController.java:29,51 | Shared Internal-Token fails closed; rating requires legacy user+restaurant+DELIVERED; restaurant decision requires restaurant+PENDING under pessimistic lock, released when request transaction ends. |

## Ordered remaining slices

1. Complete Saga status application orchestration through transaction/store/receipt ports; preserve receipt-before-order locking, stale receipt commit, gap rollback and ACK proof.
2. Extract restaurant/payment transaction/store orchestration through application ports; domain lifecycle/receipt decisions and cross-topic convergence/replay integration proof are now extracted (slice 2 below).
3. Ownership/read and cancellation/refund-intent domain policies are extracted (slice 3 below), preserving principal fallback and exception precedence; application transaction/store orchestration remains for later consolidation.
4. Create/preview admission, canonical fact checks and availability, pricing,
   shipping distance/rounding, serviceability/ETA and quote lifecycle decisions
   are extracted (slice 4 and remainder below), preserving distinct error
   precedence. HTTP/transaction/store orchestration remains for slices 5–6.
5. Extract create/quote/idempotency/reservation orchestration and compensation/lease recovery with DB race and remote ambiguous-failure proof.
6. Extract outbox lease/retry application orchestration; relocate adapters/composition to infrastructure and entrypoint/config to boot; remove host only after packaged HTTP/Kafka/Postgres recovery proof and inventories/packaging updates (outside this slice).

## Observed pre-existing discrepancies (preserved)

- Cancellation comment promises ADMIN any-state cancellation, but the shared transition table rejects PICKED_UP, DELIVERING and terminal states. Do not change either contract in this extraction.
- SHIPPER read ownership compares authenticated legacy user ID with shipperId, while product overview names shipper.id canonical. Identity migration needs separate authority/proof.
- No-shipper handler does not validate simulation context or set updatedAt; refund snapshot uses existing updatedAt if present. Delivery/assignment handlers do validate context. Preserved, not repaired here.
- The consolidation plan records an earlier Docker-enabled SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest baseline failure (missing retryKafkaTemplate); current execution result must distinguish available Docker proof from skipped classes.

## Slice 1 implementation and equivalence evidence

- `order/domain` inherits the build-parent JaCoCo check with 85% LINE and BRANCH
  minima; root reactor lists it before the unchanged `order-service` host and
  host directly depends on `order-domain:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.
- Domain owns canonical enum/aliases/transition table, delivery status mapping,
  confirmation bridge, assignment/no-shipper decisions, sequence admission and
  command admission/exact receipt replay. No framework/host/contracts dependency.
  No application-api/application module is created: transaction/store/receipt
  orchestration remains a future coherent use-case extraction, not an empty layer.
- Host enum remains a persistence/DTO mapping facade. Invalid external enum text
  is translated to preserve the original fully qualified host enum error message.
  Sequence GAP translates back to the original SagaOrderSequenceGapException.
- Receipt lookup/insert/fingerprint, pessimistic query, transaction annotations,
  cursor assignment before handler, timestamps, notes, shipper writes, save calls,
  refund/cancellation events, outbox enqueue, ACK/retry routing, schema, wire types,
  messages and feature flags remain host-owned and unchanged.
- Exhaustive domain tests cover all 100 source/target state pairs, self/null,
  terminal states, canonical/legacy aliases, case-sensitive delivery mappings,
  bridge/no-op paths, all assignment/replay/no-shipper states, every receipt
  identity field/validation precedence, and sequence legacy/stale/next/gap bounds.
- Added H2 integration proof exercises actual proxied processor/domain/JPA:
  receipt+cursor+bridge commit, stale receipt commit without effects, gap and
  invalid-transition rollback, identical gap retry after predecessor, and legacy
  acceptance before fencing/rejection after fencing. Original listener, event,
  receipt, converter and PostgreSQL concurrency assertions are retained.

## Slice 1 validation result / historical parent handoff

Branch `refactor/order-core` already existed; HEAD and main both pointed to
`3bcf2c7e7f6407a222e1cc820a6819a8f88e57cd`. No git write commands or docs/plans edits.

- `mvn -B -pl :order-domain -am clean verify`: exit 0; 8 tests,
  zero failures/errors/skips. Domain JaCoCo: LINE 80/80 (100%), BRANCH 99/99 (100%);
  both 85% gates passed. Log: `/tmp/order-domain-verify.log`.
- Required `mvn -B -pl :order-service -am clean verify`, with sandbox escalation:
  exit 1; Order host 161 tests, zero failures, **one error**, zero skips.
  Sole error: existing `SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest` cannot inject
  `KafkaTemplate<String,String>` qualified `retryKafkaTemplate`. This reproduces
  the baseline defect recorded in consolidation plan lines 137–142. Prometheus
  and both PostgreSQL concurrency classes passed. Log:
  `/tmp/order-reactor-verify-unsandboxed.log`.
- First sandboxed invocation hit local-server `Operation not permitted` and
  skipped `OrderCreateIdempotencyPostgresConcurrencyTest`,
  `SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest`, and
  `SagaOrderCommandPostgresConcurrencyTest` (one test each). Escalated invocation
  resolved the environment restriction and ran all three: **no Docker-only skips
  in the definitive full run**. Log: `/tmp/order-reactor-verify.log`.
- Focused `mvn -B -pl :order-service -am verify
  -Dtest=OrderStatusTest,SagaStatusPolicyTest,SagaCommandIdentityTest,SagaCommandReceiptServiceTest,SagaCommandReceiptTransactionIntegrationTest,SagaCommandListenerTest,OrderEventServiceTest,SagaOrderCommandPostgresConcurrencyTest
  -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`: exit 0; domain 8 + host 43 tests,
  zero failures/errors/skips; host packaged successfully. Log:
  `/tmp/order-focused-verify.log`. This is focused equivalence evidence, not a
  substitute for the failing full acceptance check.
- Final transaction test clarifies that a gap retries the identical status/event
  after its predecessor; final focused non-Docker verification is recorded in
  `/tmp/order-focused-final-verify.log`: exit 0, domain 8 + host 42 tests,
  zero failures/errors/skips; both coverage checks and host packaging passed.
- `git diff --check` passes; source inspection finds no Spring, Jakarta, Jackson
  or Lombok imports in domain production code.

**Historical NEEDS_CONTEXT (fixture repair authorized and handled in slice 2 below):** implementation and focused equivalence proof are complete,
but full zero-error acceptance cannot be met while preserving known defects.
Parent must authorize a separate repair of Kafka test/composition wiring, or
handle the baseline acceptance decision. This task does not fix that defect.

## Slice 2: restaurant/payment lifecycle and receipt decisions

- `RestaurantPaymentPolicy` in domain owns restaurant event admission in the
  original validation order, every confirmation/rejection state decision,
  cancellation reason defaults, non-COD payment compatibility decisions and
  exact restaurant receipt replay binding/conflict rules. Host
  `OrderEventServiceImpl` delegates these rules directly. No application module
  is needed for this domain slice; transaction/store orchestration remains in
  the host and is still required before the service consolidation is complete.
- Pessimistic order lock before admission/receipt lookup, serialized DTO SHA-256,
  event-before-order receipt lookup, insert/flush before status decisions,
  transactional rollback, timestamps/notes, immutable compensation snapshots,
  outbox enqueue and listener ACK order are retained. No production defaults,
  flags, topics, schema or wire contracts change.
- Domain tests enumerate every status for restaurant confirmation/rejection and
  every status across COD/online/unknown/empty/null payment methods; admission
  precedence, every receipt identity field, null/empty reason semantics and
  the existing payment-failure transition table are covered.
- Real proxied H2/JPA integration tests prove both restaurant/Saga topic arrival
  orders converge, exact replay preserves timestamps/notes, changed payload and
  opposite/new-event decisions fail closed, rejection writes one immutable
  compensation snapshot, ineligible decisions roll back receipts, receipt +
  cancellation + outbox roll back together and retry, COD no-ops, online
  completion replay, system cancellation and post-pickup failure rollback.

### Kafka fixture repair and newly observable pre-existing discrepancy

- The old test injection at
  `order-service/src/test/java/com/delivery/order_service/listener/SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest.java:100`
  requested `KafkaTemplate<String,String>` named `retryKafkaTemplate`. Order's
  shared production configuration exposes only `commonKafkaTemplate` /
  `kafkaTemplate` with `KafkaTemplate<String,Object>`
  (`platform/kafka-starter/src/main/java/com/delivery/platform/kafka/CommonKafkaProducerConfig.java:55`).
  Its producer uses JsonSerializer (line 47). This is a stale test dependency,
  not a missing profile/property or a defect requiring new production beans.
- The test now injects the existing shared template, sends the same command text
  through its real JSON transport, and decodes the JSON-encoded DLT string before
  comparing the entire original payload. No bean/serializer replacement or
  production configuration modification is introduced.
- Docker execution also exposed a stale DLT assertion: Order has no enabled
  RetryableTopic infrastructure, so the active shared factory's error handler
  recovers to the default `.DLT`, not the annotation's `.order.DLT`
  (`CommonKafkaConsumerConfig.java:97`, `CommonKafkaErrorHandler.java:22`).
  The fixture creates/asserts the actual `.DLT` with both source partitions.
  The annotation/runtime retry and owner-DLT discrepancy is preserved for a
  separately authorized platform/runtime decision; this slice does not enable
  nonblocking retries or change poison-message retry classification.
- Initial raw-string fixture experiment failed before any receipt: shared JSON
  deserialization did not deliver the expected String command. Switching to the
  existing shared producer proved receipt/replay convergence; that run then
  failed only waiting for the stale `.order.DLT` expectation. Logs:
  `/tmp/order-slice2-clean-verify.log`, `/tmp/order-kafka-wiring-focused.log`.

### Slice 2 final validation

- Required `mvn -B -pl :order-service -am clean verify`: exit 0, BUILD SUCCESS;
  completed 2026-10-05 22:30:49 +07:00. Log:
  `/tmp/order-slice2-final-clean-verify.log`.
- Domain: 12 tests, zero failures/errors/skips. JaCoCo LINE 107/107 (100%) and
  BRANCH 132/132 (100%); both 85% gates passed. Host: 168 tests, zero
  failures/errors/skips; executable Spring Boot JAR packaged successfully.
- Docker-only skips: **none**. Actual
  `SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest` (1 test),
  `OrderCreateIdempotencyPostgresConcurrencyTest` (1 test), and
  `SagaOrderCommandPostgresConcurrencyTest` (1 test) all passed. PostgreSQL
  migrations, two Kafka replica groups, historical replay, contradictory
  command recovery to the actual DLT and source-offset recovery all ran.
- Initial focused domain/lifecycle validation passed: 4 new domain tests and
  25 host tests (19 existing + 6 initial transaction cases), zero
  failures/errors/skips; `/tmp/order-slice2-focused.log`. The final clean run
  includes the seventh transaction case for post-pickup payment failure.
- `git diff --check` passes; domain production remains framework-independent.
  All edits are under `order/` and `order-service/`; no git writes,
  `docs/plans/` changes or production-default changes.

**Complete for the authorized domain slice and fixture repair.** Remaining
application port/transaction orchestration and the observed inactive
RetryableTopic/owner-DLT discrepancy are explicitly retained, not repaired by
this equivalence slice.

## Slice 3: ownership/read and cancellation/refund intent

- Framework-free `OrderOwnershipPolicy` owns detail/cancellation role admission,
  principal ownership, gated fallback for unmigrated customer/creator rows,
  legacy SHIPPER detail ownership and list admission/denial precedence. The
  existing restaurant-owner wire role is `SHOP_OWNER`. Host maps access outcomes
  to the original `AccessDeniedException` messages and fallback metric labels;
  query execution/paging/mapping and enforcement configuration remain host-owned.
- `OrderCancellationPolicy` owns exact actor/reason replay, pre-pickup eligibility,
  typed actor cancellation source/reason and system no-shipper refund intent/reason
  defaults. It does not decide Settlement/provider refund eligibility. The host
  retains lock → permission → exact replay → eligibility → canonical transition
  → mutation/timestamp → save → metric → outbox → response ordering. ADMIN only
  bypasses eligibility; the canonical transition still rejects post-pickup and
  non-cancelled terminal states. Exact replay keeps the saved timestamp and emits
  no new event. Legacy replay fallback/metrics and null/empty reason semantics
  remain unchanged.
- Existing transaction annotations, snapshots, topics, event types, configuration,
  DTOs and schemas are unchanged. No application ports/modules were introduced:
  this follows the prior domain-policy slice pattern; transaction/store/outbox
  orchestration remains host-owned for later consolidation.
- Domain tests exhaust role/principal/legacy/enforcement/read-vs-cancel combinations,
  every cancellation status, every replay identity/reason combination, typed
  intents and no-shipper reason defaults. Host regressions preserve ADMIN's
  transition discrepancy, SHIPPER's legacy ID discrepancy, SHOP_OWNER wire role,
  fallback metrics, permission-before-replay/status and missing-order precedence,
  list denial-before-query/status parsing. Real proxied H2/JPA tests prove
  cancellation/snapshot/outbox commit, exact replay/conflict and atomic rollback
  followed by retry; existing lock/save/event ordering proof is retained.
- No new business/runtime defect observed. Existing documented ADMIN, SHIPPER,
  no-shipper simulation/timestamp and inactive RetryableTopic/owner-DLT
  discrepancies remain preserved. Tests also retain existing malformed/null
  legacy-ID `NullPointerException` behavior rather than introducing new admission
  semantics; persisted legacy IDs are expected to be non-null.
- Filesystem changes only, under `order/` and `order-service/`; no git commands,
  `docs/plans/` edits, POM changes or coverage-gate reductions.

### Slice 3 final validation

- Required `mvn -B -pl :order-service -am clean verify` with sandbox escalation
  for local server/Docker integration access: exit 0, **BUILD SUCCESS**.
  Log: `/tmp/order-slice3-clean-verify.log`.
- Domain: 18 tests, zero failures/errors/skips; JaCoCo LINE 147/147 (100%) and
  BRANCH 220/220 (100%). Both unchanged 85% gates passed. Host: 176 tests,
  zero failures/errors/skips; executable Spring Boot JAR packaged successfully.
- Docker-only skips: **none**. `OrderCreateIdempotencyPostgresConcurrencyTest`,
  `SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest`, and
  `SagaOrderCommandPostgresConcurrencyTest` each ran and passed (one test each).
- Initial `mvn -B -pl :order-domain -am clean verify`: exit 0, all domain tests
  and 85% checks passed; `/tmp/order-slice3-domain.log`. Initial focused
  `mvn -B -pl :order-service -am verify
  -Dtest=OrderOwnershipPolicyTest,OrderCancellationPolicyTest,OrderServiceCanonicalPricingTest,OrderOutboxTransactionIntegrationTest,OrderEventPublisherTopicConfigurationTest
  -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`: exit 0; domain 6 + host 34 tests,
  zero failures/errors/skips; `/tmp/order-slice3-focused.log`. This preceded the
  final SHOP_OWNER regression; the definitive clean run includes that regression
  and the final production policies.
- Final source inspection confirms no framework imports in domain production;
  no new trailing whitespace in the added/changed blocks. No git-based checks
  were run, per this slice's filesystem-only instruction.

**Complete for slice 3 domain policy extraction.** No observed pre-existing
business discrepancy was fixed; future application/adapter consolidation and
separate policy/runtime decisions remain outside this slice.

## Slice 4: create admission, canonical pricing and shipping policies

- Completed the authorized admission/pricing fallback, plus shipping distance
  and fee decisions. Framework-free `CheckoutAdmissionPolicy` owns USER create
  admission before the concurrency permit, required fields, COD-only payment,
  item/quantity/duplicate limits, phone/coordinate checks, voucher feature gates,
  selection rules and livestream/flash/voucher incompatibilities. Host maps HTTP
  selections to domain facts without including client money; the stacking
  capability port is evaluated lazily at the original validation point.
- `CheckoutPricingPolicy` owns canonical restaurant/item acceptance, regular vs
  livestream price resolution through `MenuPricePort`, flash identity/quantity
  binding, exact BigDecimal line/subtotal/discount/customer-shipping/total and
  payable-food checks. Create and preview delegate common arithmetic. Streamed
  subtotal resolution retains interleaved lookup/arithmetic exception precedence;
  regular facts are still required even for livestream price overrides. Host
  retains transport decoding, price-fact adapters, flash selection mapping,
  wire-specific errors, reservation rails and immutable persistence snapshots.
- `ShippingPolicy` owns Vietnam finite-coordinate admission, the unchanged
  Haversine calculation, 12,000 base for two km, 4,500 per extra km, surcharge
  `UP` to integer VND, 12,000–50,000 clamp and final 500-VND `HALF_UP` rounding.
  The host facade retains its API (including the unused subtotal parameter) and
  original ValidationException message. No monetary scale normalization was
  introduced; ordinary checkout money remains unrounded exactly as before.
- Domain regressions cover required-field boundaries, null/invalid items,
  duplicate and quantity limits, voucher-mode/count/capability combinations,
  feature incompatibilities and accumulated error order; canonical missing,
  nonpositive/nonfinite facts; livestream lookup precedence, flash binding,
  fractional money, discount limits, payable threshold and legacy shipping
  fallback; every invalid coordinate position, Haversine and both rounding
  stages/base/cap boundaries. Host regressions prove exact accumulated errors
  before remote access and unrounded canonical item/subtotal/total snapshots
  despite an unrelated client price. Existing preview/reservation/quote and
  transaction/compensation regressions remain in the full run.

### Preserved discrepancies observed in slice 4

- Create admission accepts NaN delivery coordinates because it uses only range
  comparisons. Canonical pickup and shipping validation reject nonfinite values;
  the later shipping failure can occur after an Order shell/reservation. Domain
  tests retain that admission behavior rather than silently changing precedence.
- Shipping subtracts double distance before `BigDecimal.valueOf` and ceiling.
  At `2 + 249.0 / 4500` km the nominal 249-VND surcharge drifts upward, ceilings
  to 250 and rounds to a 500-VND surcharge. `Math.nextDown` of that distance rounds
  to zero surcharge. Tests preserve both observed results; no numerical-policy
  repair was made.
- Existing distinct create/preview voucher-mode admission and quote validation
  versus consume error precedence are retained. They must not be unified by a
  future extraction without a separately authorized behavior change.

### Slice 4 final validation and remaining work

- Required `mvn -B -pl :order-service -am clean verify`, escalated for local
  server/Docker access: exit 0, **BUILD SUCCESS**, finished
  2026-10-05T23:19:34+07:00. Log: `/tmp/order-slice4-clean-verify.log`.
- Domain: 30 tests; host: 178 tests; zero failures/errors/skips in both.
  Domain JaCoCo LINE 290/290 (100%), BRANCH 421/422 (99.76%); unchanged 85%
  LINE/BRANCH checks passed. Admission has one unreachable private phone-helper
  null branch because its caller checks non-null before invocation. Pricing and
  shipping production policies have 100% LINE and BRANCH coverage.
- Docker-only skips: **none**. `OrderCreateIdempotencyPostgresConcurrencyTest`,
  `SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest` and
  `SagaOrderCommandPostgresConcurrencyTest` each ran and passed (one test each).
  Executable Spring Boot JAR packaged successfully.
- Focused `mvn -B -pl :order-domain -am clean verify`: exit 0, 30 tests and both
  85% gates passed; `/tmp/order-slice4-domain.log`. The first domain iteration
  exposed the double rounding boundary above; its assertion was corrected to the
  existing behavior and the final full run includes that regression.
- Reviewed filesystem diffs against pre-edit copies and inspected source/whitespace;
  domain has no framework imports. All source edits are under `order/` and
  `order-service/`; no git commands, POM changes, docs/plans edits, coverage-gate
  reductions, production defaults, transaction or schema changes.

**Complete for the authorized admission/pricing fallback and shipping policy.**
Slice 4 remains partial: preview-specific admission, canonical catalog parsing /
line availability, serviceability and ETA response/prep-time policy remain in
`CheckoutPreviewService`; quote owner/input/expiry/used/reprice and consume
policies remain in `CheckoutQuoteService`, with fingerprint/TTL issuance in the
host. Host HTTP clients, transaction/store orchestration, reservation and
compensation/lease recovery remain for slice 5 and adapter consolidation for
slice 6. No new application modules or empty layers were introduced.


## Slice 4 remainder: preview catalog/admission/ETA and quote lifecycle

- Framework-free `CheckoutPreviewPolicy` owns preview's distinct first-error
  admission, item/quantity/duplicate checks, voucher selection/mode and capability
  gating, flash/livestream incompatibilities, canonical restaurant acceptance,
  raw fact coercion, menu line availability and ordered unavailable IDs.
  `CatalogFactsPort` supplies decoded canonical facts; `EtaClient` supplies
  typed min/max/source facts; stacking capability remains lazy. Host DTOs and
  HTTP clients do not enter domain dependencies.
- Canonical checks retain name → latitude → longitude → gated serviceability →
  prep-time → item parsing order. Missing/unparseable prep still defaults to 30;
  the 1–240 bound remains ETA-gated. Boolean string coercion, malformed numeric
  nulls, last duplicate catalog ID winning and exact BigDecimal scale remain
  unchanged. ETA empty/invalid responses retain their IllegalStateException
  cause and host retryable dependency exception mapping; no fallback is added.
- `CheckoutQuotePolicy` owns required/missing quote, owner/expiry/used/input
  validation, consume admission, price comparison, TTL arithmetic and the
  legacy single-voucher repricing selection. Clock and fingerprint suppliers
  preserve short-circuit evaluation. Validate still reports wrong owner as
  QUOTE_MISMATCH before expiry; consume reports wrong owner/expiry as
  QUOTE_EXPIRED before used. Expiry equality is invalid in both paths.
- Host keeps remote pricing before the write transaction, fingerprint encoding,
  replacement persistence before PRICE_CHANGED details, quote UUID generation,
  pessimistic consume lock, entity mutation and independent quote persistence.
  Existing common pricing/shipping arithmetic and rounding are unchanged.
- New domain tests cover admission boundaries/error precedence and feature
  combinations, the catalog price/name/availability/stock matrix, malformed
  facts, coordinate endpoints/nonfinite/adjacent doubles, canonical check order,
  serviceability combinations and eager fact decoding before rejection,
  prep/ETA boundaries and unchanged client causes;
  quote tests enumerate owner × expiry × used × input outcomes, lazy supplier
  precedence, exact nanosecond expiry, TTL and legacy voucher selection.
  Host regressions additionally assert API exception codes/messages, no remote
  pricing for rejected quotes and no mutation of already-consumed quotes.

### Remainder validation

- Definitive `mvn -B -pl :order-service -am clean verify`, escalated for local
  server/Docker access: exit 0, **BUILD SUCCESS**, finished
  2026-10-06T00:45:54+07:00. Log:
  `/tmp/order-slice4-remainder-definitive-clean-verify.log`.
- Domain: 40 tests; host: 182 tests; entire reactor: 279 tests. Zero
  failures/errors/skips. The three Docker tests
  `OrderCreateIdempotencyPostgresConcurrencyTest`,
  `SagaOrderKafkaPostgresIntegrationTest` and
  `SagaOrderCommandPostgresConcurrencyTest` each ran and passed (one test each).
  The executable Spring Boot JAR packaged successfully.
- Domain JaCoCo LINE 477/477 (100%), BRANCH 666/668 (99.70%). Existing 85%
  LINE/BRANCH gates passed unchanged. Quote policy: 100% LINE/BRANCH.
  Preview policy: LINE 152/152 (100%), BRANCH 217/218 (99.54%); its one
  unreachable branch is the trailing non-null legacy voucher check after
  selected IDs/mode checks (a valid legacy voucher already makes IDs nonempty).
  The other unreachable branch is the previously documented create phone null
  helper branch. No reachable policy branch remains uncovered.
- Initial focused preview/quote host run: 22 tests, zero failures/errors/skips,
  `/tmp/order-slice4-remainder-focused.log`. Initial domain verification: 39
  tests, zero failures/errors/skips and unchanged gates passed,
  `/tmp/order-slice4-remainder-domain.log`. Two earlier complete clean runs
  also passed; the definitive run includes the final canonical-port and eager
  serviceability-decoding regressions.
- Reviewed host filesystem diffs against pre-edit copies and inspected final
  source/test whitespace. No framework imports in domain production code.
  Edits stay under `order/` and `order-service/`; no git commands, POM changes,
  docs/plans edits, Kafka consumer configuration, rollout defaults, transaction
  boundaries, schema, monetary arithmetic or rounding changes.

**Slice 4 domain extraction is complete.** Remaining HTTP/transaction/store,
create/reservation/idempotency/compensation orchestration and adapter/boot
consolidation stay in slices 5–6; no empty application modules are introduced.
